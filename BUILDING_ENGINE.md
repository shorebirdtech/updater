# Building the Shorebird Flutter Engine

Shorebird uses a modified version of the Flutter engine.  Normally
when you use Shorebird, you would use the pre-built engine binaries
that we provide.  However, if you want to build the engine yourself,
this document describes how to do that.

The primary modification Shorebird makes to the stock Flutter engine
is adding support for the updater library.  The updater library is
written in Rust and is used to update the code running in the Flutter
app.  The updater library is built as a static library and is linked
into the Flutter engine during build time.

## Building the Updater Library

### Installing Rust

The updater library is written in Rust.  You can install Rust using
rustup.  See https://rustup.rs/ for details.

## Building for Android

Rust Android tooling *mostly* works out of the box, but needs a little
of configuration to get it to work.

The best way I found was to install:
https://github.com/bbqsrc/cargo-ndk

```bash
cargo install cargo-ndk
rustup target add \
    aarch64-linux-android \
    armv7-linux-androideabi \
    x86_64-linux-android \
    i686-linux-android
```

Once you have cargo-ndk installed, you can build the updater library:

```bash
cargo ndk --target aarch64-linux-android --target armv7-linux-androideabi build --release
```

### Setting up to build the Flutter Engine:

These steps assume that you have [installed the dependencies for building the Flutter engine](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Setting-up-the-Engine-development-environment#getting-dependencies).

- Outside of any existing git repository, create an empty directory named `engine`.
- Move to the `engine` directory.
- Paste the context of https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shorebirdtech/build_engine/main/build_engine/dot_gclient into a file named `.gclient`.
- Run `gclient sync` to download the Flutter engine source code (this will take a while).
- Move to the `src/flutter` directory.
- Run `git checkout flutter-release/X.Y.Z` to checkout the version of the Flutter engine that Shorebird uses.
  - X.Y.Z is currently 3.10.0.
- Move back to the `src` directory.
- Run `gclient sync` again.

Or, as one set of commands:

```bash
mkdir engine && \
  cd engine && \
  curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shorebirdtech/build_engine/main/build_engine/dot_gclient > .gclient && \
  gclient sync &&
  cd src/flutter &&
  git checkout flutter-release/3.10.0 &&
  cd .. &&
  gclient sync
```

The `updater` source should now be in `src/third_party/updater`.

## Building Flutter Engine

You can either build the full set of Android targets using a script (that
should/will eventually be a Docker container) or you can build targets
individually.

### Build all Android targets for release
The script to build all Android targets is at
https://github.com/shorebirdtech/build_engine/blob/main/build_engine/build.sh

### Build individual Android targets
You can also build Android targets manually.

Build `host_release`:

```bash
cd src && \
  ./flutter/tools/gn --runtime-mode=release --no-goma && \
  ninja -C out/host_release && \
  say "done"
```

Build the engine for Android arm64:

```bash
cd src && \
  ./flutter/tools/gn --android --android-cpu arm64 --runtime-mode=release --no-goma && \
  cd third_party/updater && \
  cargo ndk --target aarch64-linux-android build --release && \
  ninja -C ../../out/android_release_arm64 && \
  say "done"
```

> **TODO**
> 
> The "Build the engine for Android arm64" step will eventually be condensed to:
> ```bash
> cd src && \
>   ./flutter/tools/gn --android --android-cpu arm64 --runtime-mode=release --no-goma && \
>   ninja -C out/android_release_arm64
> ```
> See https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/463.

> **📝 NOTE**
> 
> In both of the examples above, `&& say "done"` is appended to the end of the
> long-running ninja command to alert me when it has finished. The `say` command
> is only available on macOS.

## Running with your local engine

`shorebird` commands support `--local-engine-src-path` and `--local-engine`,
just like `flutter` commands do.

When testing on my machine, I use something like:

```bash
$PATH_TO_ENGINE_SRC="$HOME/Documents/GitHub/engine/src"
shorebird --local-engine-src-path=$PATH_TO_ENGINE_SRC --local-engine=android_release_arm64 run
```


# For iOS

```
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios x86_64-apple-ios
```

```
cargo build --target aarch64-apple-ios --target x86_64-apple-ios --release
```

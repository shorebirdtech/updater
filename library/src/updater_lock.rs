// at once.  We have a *separate* lock from UpdateConfig because we want to
// only guard against multiple updates at once, not against multiple threads
// trying to read the config at once.  We also want to allow multiple threads
// to read the config at once while an update is running.
// We could share code with config.rs which does similar for UpdateConfig.

// UpdateConfig lock because the updater thread *will* block on getting the
// UpdateConfig lock while holding the Updater lock.  Allowing the inverse
// could cause a deadlock.  We could add a check for that here by doing a
// tryLock on the UpdateConfig lock and erroring out if we can't get it, but
// that would probably have false postives since it is OK for some other call to
// be holding the UpdateConfig lock while another thread asks for the Updater
